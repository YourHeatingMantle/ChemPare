It&#39;s particularly useful for cleaning electronic components (such as circuit boards) because it evaporates quickly, leaving no residue.\tCleaning Agent: In addition to its use as a solvent, 99% isopropyl alcohol is a powerful cleaning agent for removing sticky residues, ink stains, or grease from various surfaces. It&#39;s also used for cleaning glass and mirrors for a streak-free finish, as well as for preparing surfaces before painting or coating, ensuring that they are free of oils and other contaminants.\tSafety-Data-SheetSpecification-Sheet",
