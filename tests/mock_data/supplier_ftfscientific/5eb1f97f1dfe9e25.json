        "description": "Manufacturing of Vinyl Acetate Monomer (VAM): Glacial acetic acid is a key ingredient in the production of VAM, which is a precursor to polyvinyl acetate and polyvinyl alcohol. These polymers are used in adhesives, paints, films, and textiles.Food Industry: In its diluted form, acetic acid is widely known as vinegar, which is used as a condiment and preservative. Glacial acetic acid can be used to adjust acidity in food products and as a food additive for flavoring.Chemical Synthesis and Pharmaceuticals: It serves as a solvent and reagent in the synthesis of various chemicals, including aspirin and other pharmaceuticals. Its properties facilitate the production of fine chemicals and active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) with high purity.Safety-Data-SheetSpecification-Sheet",
